Often for dinner, it is one of our <a href=\"https://ifoodreal.com/healthy-dinner-recipes/\">dinner recipes</a>. Many nights, I love making a huge pot of <a href=\"https://ifoodreal.com/healthy-soup-stew-recipes/\">soup or stew</a> because it makes 2 dinners or leftovers for lunch - we grew up eating soup every day! Then another night it can be leftovers of all sorts plus fridge items that have to be eaten. And quite often it's \"everything but kitchen sink\" salads with store-bought healthier dressing. And occasionally cereal, frozen pizza, potstickers and Annie's mac and cheese when we are just \"done\". <br/><br/>Healthy eating is all about balance!
